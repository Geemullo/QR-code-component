in this project I was able to reinforce learning about flexbox, which was my choice to organize the page elements

```html
<main class="all-content">
    <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png">
    <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
    <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </main>
```
```css
.all-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```
